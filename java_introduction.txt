Java Programming
- Object Oriented
- Platform Independent - WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere
- High Level Language
------------------------------------------------
Creating first program in Java
- Every program needs to be started with a class
- Class Name should be (not must) started with Capital letter
- Class Name and file name must be same (Byte code will be generated with the name of class)
- Class Name starts with an alphabet or underscore or dollar sign
-------------------------------------------
Execution Steps
- we need to compile the program
  javac ClassName.java -> Java triggers JDK, it compiles the program and generate byte code
- we need to interpret the code
  java ClassName	-> JRE is triggered here and it executes the code
--------------------------------------------
Why main method is public ?
  - JRE uses main method : java ByteCode
  - because main is the entry point of program and if it is not public than JRE won't be able to find it
  - JRE loads our class in memory
Why main method is static ?
  - in java static things are loaded with class
Why main method is void ?
  - Because main method returns nothing...

What is System ?
- System is a pre-defined class in Java used for 3 things :
  - System.in	- for taking input 
  - System.out	- for showing output
  - System.err	- for displaying error
What is out ?
  - out is a member of System class and it belongs to PrintStream Class in Java
What is println ?
  - println is a method of PrintStream Class used to print anything on console
