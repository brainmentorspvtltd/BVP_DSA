Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
  - take 0th element as min element
  - compare min element with second element, if second element is smaller than assign second element as min
  - at the end of first iteration of i we get minimum element and we place that element on 0th index
  - after each iteration min element is placed in front of unsorted array

- Insertion Sort
- Merge 2 sorted arrays
    i/p : arr_1[] = {6,9,10,15}, arr_2[] = {1,3,7,11,14,20};
    o/p : 1,3,6,7,9,10,11,14,15,20
- Merge Sort
  - based on Divide and Conquer

Majority Element
- element that appears more than n/2 in an array

- Naive Approach
- Hashmap
- Using Divide & Conquer - HW
- Using Boyer Moore Vooting Algorithm
