Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
  - take 0th element as min element
  - compare min element with second element, if second element is smaller than assign second element as min
  - at the end of first iteration of i we get minimum element and we place that element on 0th index
  - after each iteration min element is placed in front of unsorted array

- Insertion Sort
- Merge 2 sorted arrays
    i/p : arr_1[] = {6,9,10,15}, arr_2[] = {1,3,7,11,14,20};
    o/p : 1,3,6,7,9,10,11,14,15,20

  - based on Divide and Conquer

Modular Arithmetic
- Modular Multiplicative Inverse
- Fermat's Theorem
- Quotient Remainder Theorem
- Chinese Remainder Theorem

Modular Addition
(a+b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m

Modular Multiplication
(a x b) mod m = ((a mod m) x (b mod m)) mod m

Modular Division

Given 3 integers
a = 8, b = 4, m = 5
find a/b under mod m.
find out c for : (b*c) % m = a % m

Modular Multiplicative Inverse
a = 3, m = 11

If we know m is prime then we use Fermat's little theorem
does Fermat theorem holds true for
given p = 5 and a = 2
16 = 1 (mod 5)

given p = 13 and a = 11

find remainder when we divide 3 ^ 100000 by 53

Minimum Spanning Tree
- sub-graph of an Undirected connected graph which will include all the vertices of the graph with minimum possible number of edges

- Prims
- Kruskal
  - sort the edges according to weights in ascending order
  - take the edge with min weight and add it to spanning tree. 
    While doing this if adding an edge leads to creation of a cycle than reject the edge
  - keep adding edges until we reach all vertices
